Pilot.ino How to


1) check you have PHP installed

2) using the Arduino IDE send the pilot.ino script to your Arduino board

3) to run the example, make the testpilot script executable. In linux, from the folder containing testpilot:

<code>sudo chmod a+x ./testpilot</code>

4) to run the example, pilotino.php must be in the same folder as testpilot

5) edit the testpilot file to setup options, like php location at the top of the file if not /usr/bin/php or the speed and name of the serial port

6) run testpilot

on linux/osx:

sudo ./testpilot

or you may launch php as a command:

php testpilot


7) watch leds connected to pins 5-13 intermittently lighting, and value of sensor connected to analog A0 displayed to console.

8) modify at your pleasure (for instance you may upload sensor value to a website instead of printing it just by calling a URL http://website.com/?sensorValue=123)
